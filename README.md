# 🔧 Builder Assessment – Responsive Landing Page

This project was developed as part of a technical assessment for a Site Builder role. The goal was to replicate a landing page based on a provided screenshot using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap within a 4-hour timeframe.

## 📄 Description

The page was built using Bootstrap Studio as a static, responsive website, implementing:

- Semantic structure in HTML5  
- Font Awesome icons  
- HTML5 form field validations using `pattern`  
- Modular and organized code using external CSS and JavaScript files  

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- Bootstrap 5  
- Font Awesome  

## 📱 Features

- Fully responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop  
- Form with built-in HTML5 validation (`pattern`, `required`)  
- Basic accessibility following semantic hierarchy and contrast best practices  

## 🧪 Validation

- Visually aligned with the provided reference design  
- Tested across multiple screen sizes  
- Compatible with modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)  

## 🕒 Time Spent

4 hours and 20 minutes, including design, layout, style adjustments, responsive testing, GitHub Pages deployment, and writing this README file.

## ⚠️ Tricky elements

Some elements took more time than others due to the importance of figuring out the best way to display them in smaller devices and present them in an accessible way.

- The form design is not very standard on desktop but was adapted for mobile in a more standard layout.  
- The device features also was particularly tricky because of the arrangement of the elements and the fact that Bootstrap framework doesn't include css grid, so I have to create it with flexbox.
